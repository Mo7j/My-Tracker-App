# My Tracker App

Colorful, dark-mode habit tracker + to-do + reminders + scheduler built with Flutter. The home view shows a timeline for today/week/month, and the bottom nav lets you jump between Timeline, Habits (heatmap style), Projects (stats + chart), and Goals (progress cards).

## Quick start

1. Install Flutter (3.13+ recommended).
2. From this folder run:
   - `flutter create .` (to generate platform scaffolding if not present)
   - `flutter pub get`
   - `flutter run`

## Tech
- Flutter + Material 3 dark theme
- `google_fonts` for typography
- `fl_chart` for the projects stats line chart
